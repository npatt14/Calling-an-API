# Calling-an-API

In this Xcode project I explored how to call an API in swift. 
I have written out an API call to both get the data decoded to JSON and fetch images in swiftUI.

The content from the API does not hold any relevancy. I simply just wanted to learn how to call upon an API
and display its data with SwiftUI.
